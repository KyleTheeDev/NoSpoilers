# NoSpoilers
Personal Project - No Spoilers social app (in progress)

Idea for App: When you start reading a book, binging a TV series, catching up on a movie - NO ONE wants to be spoiled. No Spoilers helps your friends know where you left off in your book, show, or if you've seen a movie before they do the unthinkable.

Functionality: Allow users to enter in a book, show, or movie from list (potentially a public api) and add their friends to track their progress on any of the 3 categories so they know the last chapter, episode, or showing you've seen without any unwanted spoilers.
